; This patch fixes issues that could happen in the first room of the castle if the player got one of the bad endings before seeing the cutscene with Hammer in that first room.
; The cutscene with Hammer would play at the same time as the bad ending cutscene, and could allow skipping the cutscene to get out of the room, escaping from the bad ending.
