
Tileset:
Each block in the tileset is 4 bytes long.
Starts from the first real tile, not the blank tile.
  Bits   1-6: Index of the tile on the tile page.
  Bits  7-12: Seems unused.
  Bits 13-17: Tile page index.
  Bit     18: Horizontal flip.
  Bit     19: Vertical flip.
  Bits 20-24: Seems unused.
  Bits 25-32: Palette index.

Collision tileset:
Each block in the tileset is 4 bytes long.
Starts from the first real tile, not the blank tile.
  00,1: The collision of this tile. See Tile collision values.
  01,1: 00
  02,1: 0B or ED
  03,1: 3C

Tile collision values:
Bitfield. Least significant bit first.
  Bit 1: Platform you can jump up through. Combine with bit 2 to get a fully solid block.
  Bit 2: Varies depending on the value of bits 5-8:
    0-3 - Solid bottom, left, and right, but top pushes you downwards and out to either the left or right.
    4-F - Floor slope when 0, ceiling slope when 1. (Vertical flip.)
  Bit 3: Varies depending on the value of bits 5-8:
    0-1 - Damage. Gets overridden by water.
    2   - Conveyor belt left.
    3   - Conveyor belt right.
    4-F - When 0, slopes from top left to bottom right. When 1, slopes from bottom left to top right. (Horizontal flip.)
  Bit 4: Water. Overrides damage.
  Bit 5-8: Shape of the block:
    0000 - Full block.
    0001 - ??? Same as 0?
    0010 - Half-height block (top half).
    0011 - Half-height block (bottom half).
    0100 - Normal slope.
    0101 - ???
    0110 - ???
    0111 - ???
    1000 - 2-part slope, highest part.
    1001 - ???
    1010 - 2-part slope, lowest part.
    1011 - ???
    1100 - 4-part slope, highest part.
    1101 - 4-part slope, higher-middle part.
    1110 - 4-part slope, lower-middle part.
    1111 - 4-part slope, lowest part.
