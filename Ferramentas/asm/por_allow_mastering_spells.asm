; This allows Charlotte's spells to gain SP like subweapons do.
; Once a spell is mastered, it will act like it is fully-charged even if half-charged.
; If you fully charge a spell that is also mastered, it acts super-charged, doing 3x damage and possibly having more projectiles than normal.
; Note that unlike subweapons, spells do not gradually scale in damage as you gain SP. They only suddenly increase once mastered.
