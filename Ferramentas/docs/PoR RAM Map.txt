  102,2: Y pos in pixels. (Not used?)
  118,4: X pos in subpixels. (Not used?)

  121,1: Green color multiplier out of 0x1F.
  122,1: Blue color multiplier out of 0x1F.

  (Note that the function responsible for reading this and finding the next free slot (0201DA80) seems to have a bug where it will skip one more slot than is necessary per group of entity slots, which can result in inefficient packing of slots together.)
