; When Soma's sprite gets swapped out for a Julius mode character, the game still tries to use the weapon-dependent swing animation that Soma would use.
; But the alternate characters don't have the proper animations, so they wind up just playing random garbage animations unrelated to attacking.

; This patch makes the game ignore the weapon-dependent animations and just use the default attack animations of whatever sprite Soma has.
; But it also preserves the lack of attack animation with the valmanway attack-while-moving property so that still works correctly.
