; This patch allows the front and back entrances of Kalidus to be unlocked separately from one another.
; Normally you'd need to unlock the front entrance first, then the back entrance.
; Trying to unlock the back entrance first would crash the game.
; With this patch you can make the separate unlocks as follows:
; * Unlock the front entrance with Var A = 6 and Var B = 3
; * Unlock the back entrance with Var A = 6 and Var B = 1 (same as vanilla)

; Remove the code that sets misc flag 0x31 when Var B is 1.
; That misc flag makes Kalidus be marked as NEW, and instead of that going away when the player enters Kalidus like a normal area, it would only go away after the player has unlocked more than one entrance into Kalidus and opens the screen to select which entrance to use.
