00 Save point.

  Allows you to warp between castles by pressing up, and between warp points in the same castle by pressing down.
  You should place two of these objects in each warp room - one should have Unique ID 0, and the other should have Unique ID 1.
  (Only the one with Unique ID 0 is necessary for the warp to work correctly, but the one with Unique ID 1 is the other half of the warp gate, so the warping between castles animation will look strange without it.)

    If Var A is 1 Var B is irrelevant, it always checks event flag 28.
