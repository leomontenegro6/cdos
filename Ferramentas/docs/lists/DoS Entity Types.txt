07 Font loader.
  Loads font for event text. Without this entity in the room, text will look like garbage.
  Var A: Event flag to check. If this flag is set, the font won't be loaded. Should be the same the event's var A. This can also just be set to 0 and the font will always be loaded (like for save rooms).
  Var B: Must be the same as the event's var B. For save rooms, must be the same as the save point's var B.
