0x4A6,"Desde o eclipse solar de 2035, minha vida\n
nunca mais foi a mesma. Foi quando\n
descobri que eu, Soma Cruz, sou a\n
reencarnação de Conde Drácula, o\n
Senhor das Trevas. No castelo de Drácula,\n
a verdade me foi revelada: Eu possuo o\n
poder de controlar as almas dos monstros\n
que habitam no castelo. Este poder maligno\n
quase me consumiu por completo, mas fui\n
salvo graças à força de meus amigos, que\n
em mim depositaram suas esperanças.\n
Faz um ano desde então e eu acreditava\n
estar em paz comigo mesmo...\n

Mas o poder da dominância voltou!\n
Arikado, o que isso quer dizer?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x02}{PORTRAIT 0x0D}
Seu poder nunca desapareceu.\n
Ele sempre esteve com você.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Você só não o queria mais,\n
desde que fugiu do castelo.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Então, todas as almas que você\n
havia dominado antes, foram\n
libertadas.\n

podia usar os poderes. Faz sentido...
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Falando nisso, quem era aquela mulher?\n
Ela parecia te conhecer.\n

Celia Fortner. Ela é a fundadora\n

Suspeitamos que ela estava\n
planejando algo, por isso estávamos\n
observando-a de perto.\n

Por que alguém como ela\n
está atrás de Soma?\n

Ela pretende ressuscitar\n
o senhor das trevas.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Tal como alguns tentaram uma vez\n
fazer com Drácula.\n

Então creio que ela não gosta do\n
fato de eu ter recusado me tornar\n
o senhor das trevas.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x02}{PORTRAIT 0x0D}
Pior que isso. Ela pretende matá-lo,\n
assim dando vida a um novo.\n

Ah não...\n

We do not desire the dark\n

For god to be perfectly\n

Perhaps that is so.\n
And perhaps it is not.\n

What is true, however, is\n
that the power of darkness\n

I'll burn you to ashes!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{NAME 0x08}{PORTRAIT 0x23}
I shall depart, also.\n

D-Dmitrii...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x08}{PORTRAIT 0x23}
I should thank my lucky\n
stars for making good my escape.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I managed to loosen myself\n
when the boy's emotions\n
shifted momentarily.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x06}{PORTRAIT 0x1D}
I thought you'd died...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{NAME 0x08}{PORTRAIT 0x23}
Shedding my former body was\n
a desperate gamble. But it \n
has worked out quite well.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x02}{PORTRAIT 0x0D}
You copied the power of\n
dominance from Soma?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x08}{PORTRAIT 0x24}
Ah, so you understand.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I touched the boy's soul\n
and copied his ability.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And I have been doubly\n
lucky in finding a suitable\n
replacement for my body.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x06}{PORTRAIT 0x1D}
Y-You obtained the same\n
power as Soma Cruz?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x08}{PORTRAIT 0x23}
When I fought the boy,\n
I confirmed one thing.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Dracula's heir need not be\n
the inheritor of the dark\n
lord's power.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I only need to possess the\n
same ability to become the\n
true dark lord's heir.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And of course, only I \n
could gain that ability.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{NAME 0x02}{PORTRAIT 0x0D}
I won't allow that.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x08}{PORTRAIT 0x23}
Have patience, Arikado.\n
Or perhaps I should address\n
you with your real name?\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
When the boy began his dark\n
transformation, I scanned\n
memories of his past lives.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Make one move, and the boy\n
will die.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You don't wish that, do you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x02}{PORTRAIT 0x0D}
Hmph.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x03}
Does becoming the dark lord\n
really mean that much to you?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x08}{PORTRAIT 0x23}
I have told you before.\n
I wish to learn what my\n
power signifies.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Celia.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I must gain dominance over\n
more powerful demons.\n
I will surpass the boy.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x06}{PORTRAIT 0x1C}
So be it.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NEXTACTION}{NAME 0x06}{PORTRAIT 0x1B}
Soma Cruz, I take back what\n
I have said to you.\n

Arikado, where do you\n
think they’ve gone?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x02}{PORTRAIT 0x0D}
I imagine that they've gone\n
to the basement of the\n
tower next to the castle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
A foul, unearthly energy\n
emanates from there.\n

There must be a portal to\n
the dark side that fuels\n
the castle's existence.\n

{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x02}{PORTRAIT 0x0D}
Without your power, it's\n
impossible for us to get through.\n

We’ll take it from here.\n

He arrived too late,\n
quite simply.\n

He gained dominance over\n
a calamitous demon.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I tried to prevent the\n
summoning ritual from\n
happening, but...\n

Your dark power failed to\n
overcome the power I gained\n
from the sacrifice.\n

?!\n

He's right.\n
His sacrifice reversed the\n

Just what is the dark lord?\n

What Celia told you wasn't\n
necessarily wrong.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
The dark lord is the entity\n
opposite to god.\n

A few days ago, Yoko waved\n
hi to me.\n

Today, you know, Yoko and\n
me, our eyes met.\n

You mean Julius?\n

Yeah, yeah, Julius.\n
He seems to come around\n
to see Yoko a lot.\n

Do you think...?\n

Of course he comes around.\n
Yoko is Julius's contact.\n

What's wrong?\n

I can kinda understand, \n
but...don't you think it's\n
a little too frequent?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
What is?\n

Julius.\n
You know, how often he\n
comes to see Yoko.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
It's their job.\n
They have to keep in touch.\n

Well, I get that, but...\n
A little age gap doesn't\n
get in the way of love.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
You're imagining things.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Yoko said that Julius is\n
just a business partner.\n

(She didn't really, but...)\n

What guy?\n

You know.\n
That Arikado guy.\n

Oh, yeah.\n
He's supposed to be keeping\n
me under watch.\n

But, eh, onto bigger things.\n
I trust Yoko and all, but\n
that “pretty boy,"" Arikado.\n

You think she likes him?\n

Yes, but Arikado doesn't\n

Yeah, that's true.\n

?\n

I just got a new magazine\n
in today, ""UMA News.""\n
It’s about real monsters.\n

I think it’s got news\n
about this area, too.\n
It's gotta be good.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
I'll buy it if I feel like it.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x04}{PORTRAIT 0x18}
Hey, but watch out.\n
Don't you dare read it\n
in my shop.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
These things sell info.\n
If you look at it for free,\n
it's the same as stealing.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
I know that.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x04}{PORTRAIT 0x18}
Okay, as long as you get\n
that through your head.\n

It's released every so \n
often, so check in to see\n
if a new issue's arrived.\n

Hey, did ya forget somethin'?\n

0x4EB,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Oh, hi, Soma.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
You're going to act as\n
Julius's contact here?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Yes. There was no one \n
living here, so I thought\n
it’d be okay.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Oh, that rough-looking \n
guy’s right across from me.\n
What was his name again?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Hammer?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Yes, that's it.\n
What is he doing here?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
He came to help me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Honestly, you didn't ask\n
him to come, did you, Soma?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Of course I didn't.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
I’m sure you wouldn’t.\n
But it's too dangerous for\n
him to be here.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Can't you tell him to\n
leave, Soma?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
I told him already.\n
He wouldn't budge.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Besides, it's hopeless now.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Especially after someone \n
who's not supposed to be \n
here showed up.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Huh? \n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Well, if he wouldn't listen to you, \n
I suppose it is hopeless.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
By the way, I gained a new\n
ability.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
A new ability?\n
What?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
So, the power of dominance\n
lets you control the souls\n
of monsters, right?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Right.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
So I thought I could use\n
magic to draw the monster \n
souls out and use them.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
You mean release the souls?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Something like that.\n
Of course, I would need\n
your cooperation, Soma.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And it's not something\n
that’s easy to do.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
So how do you plan to use\n
these freed souls?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Well, I can fuse the freed\n
souls with a weapon, thus\n
creating a new weapon.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
The souls you use will be\n
lost, though.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Can you even do that?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
That's rather rude of you to ask!\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I may not look the part,\n
but I am considered an\n
exceptional spell caster.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Just tell me if you need something.\n
I'll prove it to you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Okay, then.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Oh, and by applying my\n
ability, I may be able to\n
reduce the souls used.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I'm not sure if you'll need\n
it, but just keep that in mind.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Got it.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
So, may I help you with\n
anything today?\n

Oh, Soma.\n

I've got word from Julius.\n
Would you like to hear it?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Of course.\n

Let's see...\n

0x4ED,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
You can get through tight\n
spaces if you could switch\n
places with a small object.\n

With your abilities, Soma,\n
there may be a way to do that.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}"
0x4EE,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
There are rooms with panels\n
that can be moved around\n
like a picture puzzle.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
There are also controls for\n
sliding the panels to make\n
a picture.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
I think some rooms can't be\n
entered unless the puzzles\n
are solved.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}"
0x4EF,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
There appear to be monsters\n
that can slip in and out of mirrors.\n

I wonder what you would be\n
able to do if you were to\n
dominate their souls...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}"
0x4F0,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
He says that keyboards let\n
you find hidden objects by\n
playing notes in sequence.\n

He didn't say what the\n
patterns were, though.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}"
0x4F1,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
There are some switches \n

hammers.\n

Unfortunately, Julius doesn't\n
know why they were made.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}"
0x4F2,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
There are walls that only\n
react to certain kinds of spells.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Since you have the power of\n
dominance, you should try\n
various spells on them.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Watch the walls closely.\n
You should be able to see\n
what needs to be done.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}"
0x4F3,"{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
There is a room in which\n
time has stopped.\n

Something may happen if you\n
use magic to affect the\n
flow of time.\n

Of course.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Let's see...\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
By equipping the talisman,\n
it should suppress the \n
darkness in your soul.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You, of all people, should\n
especially be aware of this.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
I see.\n

That's what Arikado had to report.\n
Anything else today?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}"

I see.\n

Hi, Soma.\n

Do you know about a monster\n

between two weapons?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
No, I don't.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
I think the monster's name\n
was Doppelganger.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
If you dominate that\n
monster's soul, it could\n
help you in fights.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You would be able to switch\n
between two weapons to suit\n
the situation.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Yeah, that sure would \n
be helpful.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}

What was that man's name?\n
Hammer?\n

I usually give him a smile,\n
but he always looks away.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
Did I do something to upset him?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
No, you're imagining it.\n
He just looks rough, so\n
it looks like he's glaring.\n

I'll ask him about it the\n
next time I have the chance.\n

It's about Julius. \n
Do you think he considers\n
me to be just a burden?\n

I...\n
I don't think he thinks that.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Soma, you saw him.\n

At the drawbridge, he left\n
without a word from me.\n

He also said the monsters\n
inside were tough, so I\n
offered to help.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}{PORTRAIT 0x14}
And do you know what?\n
He turned me down as if\n
I were a child!!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Whoa, calm down.\n

What?\n
Are you on Julius' side,\n
too, Soma?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
No, that's not it.\n
I'm sure that Julius is\n
just worried about you.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x14}
But I can fight, too.\n
There's no need for him to\n
worry about me!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Yoko, you just don't\n
understand how a guy thinks.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
He just cares about you\n
and doesn’t want to see\n
you get hurt.\n

That would be ten times\n
worse than getting hurt himself.\n

Wh-What, what are you\n
talking about now?!\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x11}
Well, Mina's like a little\n
sister to me.\n
So it makes me wonder.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x06}
Well, then ask her \n
yourself, as if you were\n
her older sister.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
And rather than worrying\n
about others, why not worry\n
about yourself?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Ouch!\n
That one stung a little.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
But you're right. In this\n
line of work, I don't get\n
to meet too many...\n

Wait, this isn't about me.\n

That's why you shouldn't\n
pry, right?\n

Welcome, Soma.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
By the way, it appears as\n
if Arikado came, too.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
Yeah, he said he's here to\n
keep an eye on me.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
I thought he was supposed\n
to be guarding Mina.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
That's what I thought, too.\n
That's why I came here\n
feeling confident.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Well, since it is him, I\n
doubt that there would be\n
any problems.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
But his being here must\n
mean this situation is very serious.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
He lectured me to behave.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
I don't blame him.\n
I would rather see you go\n
home, too.\n

But I...\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
I understand that.\n

But it's not a bad thing to\n
rely on the help of others.\n

Don't try to carry the\n

What can you tell me about\n
that Celia woman?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
All I know is that she's\n
the priestess of this cult.\n

And the fact that she has\n
the ability to open gates\n
to the dark side.\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x00}{PORTRAIT 0x00}
What can she do by opening\n
those gates?\n
{WAITINPUT}{NEWCHAR}{NAME 0x03}{PORTRAIT 0x10}
Mainly summon monsters\n
and demons.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
She also creates zones that\n
that draw energy from the dark side.\n
{WAITINPUT}{SAMECHAR}
You'll need magic seals to\n
close those gates.\n

You defeated Dmitrii?\n

Yes, but it was weird.\n

I didn't finish him.\n
