; In Dawn of Sorrow, luck has very little effect on soul/item drop chances. Even a full 99 luck only gives you about +0.04% chance for soul drops or about +0.25% for item drops. (The exact amount it gives depends on the base chance of the drop, but it's never a significant amount.)

; Fixes how luck affects soul drops. With this fixed formula each point of luck gives +0.1% drop chance.

  mov r2, r5, lsl 5h ; Multiply luck by 0x20.
.org 0x021C3A68
  mov r7, r2 ; Put it in r7.
.org 0x021C3A6C
  movne r7, r7, lsl 2h ; Multiply by 4 if in hard mode. This is the same as the original code, just done in a way that won't break when luck is over 255.

  mov r0, 8000h ; Always use 0x8000 as the max random number to generate, instead of basing it off the player's luck. This makes the calculation simpler.

  add r6, r7, r6, lsl 6h ; r6 is the enemy's base soul drop chance defined in its enemy DNA. Multiplying that by 0x40 was already done in the original code, the only thing we change here is also adding r7, which contains (luck*0x20).

; Fixes how luck affects item drops. With this fixed formula each point of luck gives +0.1% drop chance.

.org 0x021C3BD0
  add r9, r0, r7, asr 2h ; Add luck*8 to drop chance and put it in r9. r7 currently has luck*0x20 (from before) so we actually divide r7 by 4 to get luck*8.
.org 0x021C3BE0
  moveq r9, r9, lsl 1h ; Double drop chance if rare ring is equipped (same as in the original code).
