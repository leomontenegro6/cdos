080C42F4-080C4303 - List of GFX pages containing item icons.

080C5428-080C5447 - List of how VRAM indexes map to tile offsets in VRAM.
  Each entry is a halfword.
  The index is a VRAM index in terms of 128x32px chunks.
  Each value is an offset in VRAM in terms of 8x8px tiles. So multiply this by 0x20 to get the offset in bytes.
  The way these indexes would map out visually to VRAM is like this:
    [    0    ] [    4    ]
    [    1    ] [    5    ]
    [    2    ] [    6    ]
    [    3    ] [    7    ]
    [    8    ] [    C    ]
    [    9    ] [    D    ]
    [    A    ] [    E    ]
    [    B    ] [    F    ]
  So e.g. E means the player's spot in VRAM, 0 means the common sprite's spot, C means the player's spell's spot, etc.

  The room's "Special Effect" number minus 1 is the index in this list.
  These functions get called with the room's "Palette Shift Type" as argument r0.
  There are 5 function in total.
  The functions:
    00 - No function
    01 - 08026A58 - Shifts palettes.
      The argument determines which palettes are shifted and how.
      Specifically, the argument is an index used to determine which function to call.
      The list of palette shifting function pointers is 084B1470.
      There are 0x13 entries in total, so the argument can be 00-12.
    02 - 08026BC8 - Gives the background the 3D-perspective effect (for Sky Walkway's sky).
    03 - 08026BE0 - Scrolls the background horizontally, and also shifts palettes.
      The argument determines which palettes are shifted and how, but if the argument is 0 no palettes will be shifted.
      Also, removing this special effect from the rooms that have it in vanilla causes them to lag very badly?
    04 - 08026C04 - Gives the background the 3D-perspective effect, and also shifts palettes.
      The argument determines which palettes are shifted and how.
    05 - 08026B34 - 3D-looking clock tower in the background.

    When switching castles by pressing up, it simply uses the door in the room that is on top of the room itself.

084950DC - List of songs that play in each sector.
  Entry length 2.
