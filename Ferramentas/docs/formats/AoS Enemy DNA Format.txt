AoS Enemy DNA format:
  0x24 bytes long.
  00,4: Create code pointer.
  04,4: Update code pointer.
  08,2: Item 1. Global ID+1 of the item.
  0A,2: Item 2. Global ID+1 of the item.
  0C,2: Max HP.
  0E,2: Max MP.
  10,2: EXP.
  12,1: Soul rarity.
    00 means the soul has no chance to drop at all, but after that it scales from common to rare.
    The formula for calculating the soul's drop chance is as follows:
      The numerator of the chance is 6 if you don't own any of the soul already, or 3 if you do.
      If you're on hard mode and you don't own any of the soul the numerator is 7 instead.
      If Soul Eater Ring is equipped, add 8 to the numerator.
      The denominator is: max(0x10, this_number*8 + 0x20 - floor(LCK/0x10))
  13,1: Attack stat.
  14,1: Defense stat.
  15,1: Item 1 rarity.
    Scales from common to rare.
    The formula for calculating item 1's drop chance is as follows:
      The numerator of the chance is 4 normally, or 8 if you have the Rare Ring equipped.
      The denominator is: max(0x10, (this_number*4 + 0x10 - floor(LCK/0x10)))
  16,1: Item 2 rarity.
    Works the same as item 1 rarity.
  17,1: Soul type.
    0 - Red soul.
    1 - Blue soul.
    2 - Yellow soul.
    3 - Ability soul.
  18,1: Soul index in that type's list.
  19,1: ???
  1A,2: Which elements this enemy is weak to. Bitfield.
  1C,2: Which elements this enemy is resistant to. Bitfield.
  1E,2: ???
  20,2: ???
    The exact effect this has seems to depend on the individual enemy's code.
    It's somehow related to the enemy entity's bitfield of sprite drawing (entity+58).
    For example, Bat will unset its "do not draw" bit of that bitfield every frame, but only if this value is 0.
  22,2: ???
