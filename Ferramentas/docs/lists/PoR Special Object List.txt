Special objects:

  Var A: Index of this wall in the breakable wall list for this area.
    The data in that list affects the sprite frame to use as well as the flag for the breakable wall being destroyed.

3F Platform that floats up and down.
  Starts at position 0x80,0x80 and moves down to 0x80,0x130, then back to its starting position.
  Var A: Which platform this is. 0-2.

    02 Door at center left and center right.
    03 Door at center left.
  This object loads the sprite data for the blue flames that appear in front of the 13th Street and Burnt Paradise portrait. Therefore this portrait must be in any room with either of those portraits, and it must be before the portraits in the room's entity list so it loads the sprite before those portraits get a chance to load in. If this object is not placed correctly, the portraits will causes crashes or serious visual bugs.

75 Portrait to the Throne Room.
  Note that it can still bring you to any area you set, but it will only display the right visuals for the above area.
  Var A: Area index of the destination room.
  Var B:
    Least significant bit first.
    Bits 1-6: Room index of destination room.
    Bits 7-10: Sector index of the destination room.
    Bits 11-16: Nothing.
  This portrait's palette is stored in sector overlay 115, the Lost Gallery's sector overlay. If you place this portrait outside of the Lost Gallery it will have the wrong colors but will otherwise function normally.
76 Portrait to 13th Street, Forgotten City, Burnt Paradise, or Dark Academy. (Uses different picture frame than 1A.)
  Note that it can still bring you to any area you set, but it will only display the right visuals for the above areas.
  Var A: Area index of the destination room.
  Var B:
    Least significant bit first.
    Bits 1-6: Room index of destination room.
    Bits 7-10: Sector index of the destination room.
    Bits 11-16: Nothing.
77 Studio portrait.
  Sealed with 4 chains. Each of these chains disappears with a different boss death flag being set: Werewolf, The Creature, Medusa, and Mummy Man.
  When the player goes into the portrait, the black effect emanating out from it actually comes from the sprite of the small square-framed portrait usually in the same room as the studio portrait. If that small portrait sprite is not currently loaded, going into the studio portrait will crash the game on real hardware, and cause visual bugs on emulator.
  Therefore you should always make sure there is an object 76 or 87 in the same room as the studio portrait. (Note that objects 1A and 86 won't work, they use a different sprite.) This dummy portrait doesn't have to be visible - you can just place it above the room so the player will never see it, but it will still load its sprite.

82 Wooden door separating areas.

  Requires sector overlay 99.

    Bits 1-6: Room index of destination room.
    Bits 7-10: Sector index of the destination room.
