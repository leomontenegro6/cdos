07 Pickup hidden inside a breakable wall.
  Subtype/Var A/Var B work the same as normal pickups.
  This should be placed together with special object 5C. Their positions don't need to be exactly the same, but close.
  If not placed inside a breakable wall, this just acts like a normal pickup not hidden inside a wall.
