
Sprite header format:
00,2: Number of frames this sprite has.
02,2: Number of animations this sprite has.
04,4: Pointer to the start of the list of the sprite's frames.
08,4: Pointer to the start of the this sprite's first animation.
  If this sprite has no animations, this is just a pointer back to this sprite header instead.
  In HoD, it always points back to this sprite header.
0C,4: Pointer to the start of the list of pointers to each of the sprite's animations.
  Only exists in AoS. In HoD, the sprite header is only 0xC bytes long.

Sprite parts:
Each part is 0xC bytes long.
  00,1: X pos (signed).
  01,1: Y pos (signed).
  02,?: ?
  04,1: X offset on the GFX page.
  05,1: Y offset on the GFX page.
  06,1: Width.
  07,1: Height.
  08,1: OBJ size and shape.
    Bits 0x0F: OBJ shape.
    Bits 0xF0: OBJ size.
  09,1: GFX page index.
    Not everything uses this as the GFX page index though - weapons for example seem to use it for something else.
  0A,1: Flip bits.
    Least significant bit first.
    Bit 1: Vertical flip
    Bit 2: Horizontal flip.
  0B,1: Affects palette?
    If the lowest bit of this value is set, then it changes the palette of this part, but only if the entity has the lowest bit of the value at entity+62 set as well.

List of hitboxes:
Each hitbox is 4 bytes long.
  00,1: X pos (signed).
  01,1: Y pos (signed).
  02,1: Width.
  03,1: Height.

List of sprite frames:
Each frame is 0x10 bytes long.
  00,4: 00 00 00 00
  04,1: The number of hitboxes this frame has.
  05,1: The number of parts this frame has.
  06,2: 00 00
  08,4: Pointer to the first hitbox to use. 0 if this frame has 0 hitboxes.
  0C,4: Pointer to the first part to use.

Animations:
Each animation is 4 bytes long.
  00,2: Number of frames in this animation.
  02,2: Function index. Index in list 080E2B34, which is a list of pointers to functions to call.
  04,?: List of keyframes in this animation. See below for the format.
    For type 0, this is a pointer to the list of keyframes.
    For types 1, 2, and 3, this is just the list itself directly.

List of keyframes for function index 0:
Each keyframe is 0x10 bytes long.
  00,1: Frame index to use.
  01,1: Delay (in frames) for this frame to be displayed.
  02,?

List of keyframes for function index 1:
Each keyframe is 4 bytes long.
  00,1: Frame index to use.
  01,1: Delay (in frames) for this frame to be displayed.
  02,2: ?

List of keyframes for function index 2:
Each keyframe is 8 bytes long.
  00,2: Frame index to use.
  02,2: Delay (in frames) for this frame to be displayed.
  04,4: Hitbox data. See the hitbox format above.

List of keyframes for function index 3:
Each keyframe is 0xC bytes long.
  00,2: Frame index to use.
  02,2: Delay (in frames) for this frame to be displayed.
  04,4: ???
    This is argument r1 to func 08042884
  08,4: Hitbox data. See the hitbox format above.
