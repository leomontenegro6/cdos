Player format:
  0x5C bytes long.
  00,4: GFX list pointer.
  04,4: Sprite pointer.
  08,4: Palette list pointer.
  0C,4: Pointer to list of which sprite animation to use for what state.
  10,2: Asset index of first GFX file.
  12,2: Asset index of sprite file.
  14,4: Walking speed.
  18,4: First jump force.
  1C,4: Second jump force.
  20,4: Slide force.
  24,4: Bitfield of what actions the player can do.
    Bit  1: Can slide.
    Bit  2: Can attack with weapons.
    Bit  6: Can jumpkick.
    Bit  7: Can up+L superjump (Griffon Wing).
    Bit  8: During a slide the player can press B again to slidejump.
    Bit 14: 
    Bit 19: Can absorb glyphs.
    Bit 22: Can hold up to do a pose.
  28,4: Bitfield of ?
    Bit 1: Player's sprite is horizontally flipped.
    Bit 2: Can smash head into ceiling if you hit it with enough force. (Normally with a superjump.)
    Bit 5: Is female.
      Has no known effect in this game.
    Bit 6: Don't interrupt double jump animation when the player releases B.
      This is used for Shanoa so her spinning animation always plays out fully.
    Bit 7: Unknown, used for Shanoa and Arma Chiroptera.
  2C,4: Backdash force.
  30,4: Backdash friction.
  34,2: Number of frames for a backdash to last.
  36,
  38,4: Elemental damage types that apply to this player's slides and jumpkicks.
    Bit 18: Take half damage and reflect projectiles.
      All damage will be exactly halved. There's no minimum of 1 damage here, so 1 damage gets halved to 0.
      Most projectiles will be destroyed on contact with you, dealing no damage. Projectiles that can't be destroyed will simply pass through you. However, Dracula's projectiles will still do damage to you.
    Bit 19: If this bit is off, the player can't be hit at all. Can still hit enemies.
  3C,4: 
  40,2: Sprite Y offset in pixels.
  42,2: Which color index within the player's palette is for the player's outline.
    Whichever color in the player's palette is at this index will glow white when absorbing glyphs.
    To be more specific, it swaps that color between the color specified in the below "Outline color" field and various shades of grey to make the outline glow when absorbing glyphs.
  44,2: Outline color.
  46,
  48,
  4C,4: Pointer to list of hitbox pointers.
    There are 0x12 pointers in this list.
    Each hitbox has this format:
    The first halfword is the number of entries in this list.
    Each entry is a signed halfword, which is the Y offset of the top of the hitbox.
    All of them are checked. They're used for stopping the player when they hit a ceiling, and pushing the player downwards when they hit the corner of a ceiling.
  50,2: Height in pixels.
    This is negative because it's the offset off the floor the player extends.
    This if for collision checking with tiles, not enemies.
  52,2: Which player face icon to use. This is a frame index in the common sprite.
    This seems unused in OoE, and is just leftover from PoR.
  54,4: Pointer to list of swing animations for Y-button glyphs.
    This points to a list of pointers, one for each swing animation type (specified in the item data for the glyph).
    Located at those pointers are a list of which animation to use in the player's sprite file depending on the state.
      In order: Attacking standing, attacking crouched, attacking in air, finish attacking standing, finish attacking crouched.
  58,4: Pointer to list of swing animations for X-button glyphs. Works the same as above.
