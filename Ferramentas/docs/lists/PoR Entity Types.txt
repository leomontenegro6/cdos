    The original developers used subtype 8 for subweapons and spells, 9 for dual crushes, and B for relics.
    But anything 8 or higher seems to work exactly the same, so you don't have to follow that.

05 Nothing? Unused?

06 Pickup that only appears once all quests have been completed.
  Subtype/Var A/Var B work the same as normal pickups.
  The only other difference from normal pickups is that this pickup won't appear if you already own at least one of the pickup.
  
07 Pickup hidden inside a breakable wall.
  Subtype/Var A/Var B work the same as normal pickups.
  This should be placed together with special object 3B. Their positions don't need to be exactly the same, but close.
  If not placed inside a breakable wall, this just acts like a normal pickup not hidden inside a wall.

08 Entity hider.
  Skips loading a certain number of entities after this one in this room's entity list if a certain condition is met.
  Byte 8: Low nibble is the number of entities after this one to skip. If 0, all remaining entities are skipped.
  Var A: The condition.
    0 - Check if a boss death flag is set. Subtype is the index of the bit. (Bitfield starting at 021119DC.)
    1 - Check if a miscellaneous flag is set. Subtype is the index of the bit. (Bitfield starting at 02111BA0.)
    2 - Check if an event flag is set. Subtype is the index of the bit. (Bitfield starting at 02111BB0.)
    3 - Check if in the middle of a boss fight. (Bit 0x00000002 of bitfield 0211174C.)
    4 - Checks if subtype equals the current game mode (Byte 02111F52 has the current game mode.)
  Var B:
    0 - Entities will disappear if the condition is NOT met.
    1 - Entities will disappear if the condition IS met.

09 Font loader.
  Loads font for event text. Without this entity in the room, text will look like garbage.
  Var A: Event flag to check. If this flag is set, the font won't be loaded. Should be the same the event's var A. This can also just be set to 0 and the font will always be loaded (like for save rooms).
  Var B: Must be the same as the event's var B. For save rooms, must be the same as the save point's var B.
