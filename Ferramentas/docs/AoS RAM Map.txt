    Note that if the player is standing when this flag is activated they will not start falling automatically, they will be able to walk left and right even if that results in them walking on thin air. If the player jumps then they will start being affected by gravity as normal, and fall through the floor.

  004 - Prevents the player's regular midair animations from being used.
    This flag is used while jumpkicking.
  008 - Makes the player immune to hard landings. No matter how far you fall you'll instantly be walking again.
  010 - Gravity no longer affects the player. If you walk off an edge the player will just float and continue moving straight left/right. If you jump you will fly upwards without slowing down, and even fly right through ceilings. But if the player takes damage they will be affected by gravity while in the hurt animation, but once they land on solid ground gravity will go back to having no affect.

  The damage done by a blue soul is equal to (INT/2) * (this_multiplier/8) + this_multiplier.

020131D6,2 - Related to how much damage the player just took.

  00000100 - Flying Armor. Fall slowly. The visual Flying Armor does not appear, you need to actual soul for that.
  00000200 - Giant Bat. Setting this bit without using the actual Giant Bat soul doesn't actually do anything. Unsetting this bit when the player is transformed into a bat does bug the transformation out though.
  00000400 - Black Panther. The player moves faster and uses the dashing sprite with visible waves, but this doesn't make the waves do damage to enemies, you need the actual soul for that.
  00000800 - ??? Cannot jump, and falls extremely slowly (about 3x slower than Flying Armor).
  00001000 - Devil/Manticore/Curly. Setting this bit without using those souls doesn't do anything. But preventing those souls from setting this bit bugs the transformation out and softlocks the game, there will just be a white silhouette of Soma floating in the air and not controllable.

02013392-02013394 - Ability souls.
  Each soul takes up a nibble (half a byte). So you can have up to 15 of each soul (or up to 30 if you use the unused second lists as well) (note that double digits slightly bug out the display number).
