  This is 1 when the player is doing a critical art/combo tech.
  This is 4 when the player is not present (neither player-controlled nor AI-controlled).
  This is 8 when the player is doing a dual crush.
  Otherwise, this counts down every frame until it reaches 0.

For room entities:
132,1: Subtype.

For enemies:
120,4: Bitfield of ???
  00002000 - If set, grants SP when killed.
    This is set when this enemy is hit by a subweapon (determined by the "is a subweapon" bit in the skill's damage types bitfield.)

138,2: The attack value from the enemy DNA.
13A,2: The physical defense value from the enemy DNA.

For skills:
110,4: Bitfield.
  00000001 - Horizontally flipped.
  00000002 - Skill was used by an enemy (e.g. Doppelganger) as opposed to the player.
    This overrides this skill's on-hurt-enemy callback function with a different one so that it hurts the player instead.
    It also changes the damage calculation formula, so that it uses the enemy's attack value in place of the player's INT, and so the enemy's attack value is weighted more than the skill's damage multiplier.
114,4: Pointer to the entity that used this skill (e.g. player/Doppelganger).
11A,2: The ID of the skill.
11D,1: The ID of the skill?
