; Changes the game initialization code to load a new overlay (119) in addition to the ones in the original game.

; First we make a little bit of space to put our new code. To do this we optimize the amount of space used by the code that loads the static overlays (0, 25, 5, 6, 7, 8).

  mov r0, 0h ; These lines in the original were like ldr r0, =0h. This meant a constant pool was necessary (from 02007704-0200771B). By using mov instead of ldr no constant pool is necessary and we can use that area for our own code.
