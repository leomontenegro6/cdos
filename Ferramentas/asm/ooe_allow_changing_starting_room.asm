; In the code for setting the starting room, r5 has the sector index put in it with a mov instruction.
; Then in the later code r5 is used for 4 different things unrelated to the sector index, as r5 is supposed to have 0 in it as that's the starting sector in the vanilla game.
; If the sector index is not 0, this causes several bugs, including an enormous max hearts count, no volume, and probably other issues.
; So we need to manually put 0 into r5 and slightly change the order of the code so it works properly when the sector index is not 0.
