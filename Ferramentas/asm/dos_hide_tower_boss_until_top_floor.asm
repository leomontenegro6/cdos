; This patch for the boss randomizer prevents the boss in Gergoth's tower from being loaded in until the player enters the top floor of the tower.
; In order for the patch to work correctly, the boss entity should be at index 1 and the tower floors entity should be at index 0 (reversed from how they are in vanilla).
