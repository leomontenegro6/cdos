  0C,1: Palette offset to use when this enemy is petrified.
  0D,1: Attribute points given when killed.
    Each Master Ring you have equipped doubles this number.
    Albus starts with two Master Rings equipped, so he always receives 4 times this number.
  0E,2: Max HP
  10,2: EXP
  12,1: Blood color.
    This is the palette offset for the blood to use in the common sprite. Offset 0 uses palette 2, etc.

  13,1: ??? Unused?
  14,2: Glyph drop. Global ID of the glyph + 1.
    The enemy can only drop a glyph on death if its AI is coded to drop a glyph.
  16,1: Chance to drop glyph
  17,1: Attack.
  18,1: Defense.
  19,1: Magical defense.
  1A,1: Chance to drop item 1

  1C,4: Weaknesses
    In OoE, weaknesses increase damage the enemy takes by 1.5x if the enemy is weak to any of the elements of the attack.
    Bit 26: Enemy takes extra damage? (117 -> 176)
  20,4: Resistances
    In OoE, resistances multiply the damage the enemy takes by 0.25x only if the enemy resists ALL elements of the attack.
    Resisting Poison/Curse/Stone/Torpor does nothing.
    Bit 32: This bit is special, it tells the function InitializeRoomEnemyOrSpecialObject to skip loading this enemy's GFX assets.
      This bit is not used by any enemies in OoE, but is in PoR.
      This bit should only be used for enemies that are specially coded to manually load their own GFX instead of leaving it up to the engine. If you set this bit for an enemy that does not load its own GFX the enemy will be invisible or have corrupted graphics because the GFX were never loaded.
