; This patch fixes a bug in PoR where the map will consider the player to be in the next room over if they are on the very edge of the screen.
; This bug causes the suspend glitch, and the glitch in room randomizer where walking through a door will reveal the map tile of the room you would have normally entered in the vanilla game without room randomizer.
