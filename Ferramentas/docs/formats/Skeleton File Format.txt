02,1: 08 or 0B or 0C or 0D
03,1D: Filename starting with "p_" and having the file extension ".opd". For example, "p_dem00.opd". This may have been the skeleton file's original filename.

22,2: X offset in pixels for the skeleton to be drawn at relative to the enemy's x pos. (Signed.)

26,1: Number of joints (includes both visible and invisible joints).
27,1: Number of invisible joints.
28,1: Number of visible joints.

List of joints:
Each is 4 bytes long. 
  00,1: Parent joint ID.
  01,1: Frame ID to use. If this is FF, it's not actually a frame, it's just a dummy invisible joint.
  02,1: Bitfield.
    Least significant bit first.
    Bits 1-2: Positional rotation of this joint around its parent. In 90 degree intervals, so 1 = 90, 2 = 180, 3 = 270.
    Bit 3: Whether this joint inherits the rotation of its parent.
    Bit 4: Horizontally flip this joint, visually.
    Bit 5: Vertically flip this joint, visually.
    Bits 6-8: ?
  03,1: Palette index.
    Might override part's palette index? TODO

List of poses:
  00,1: Joint ID for something? FF means the next byte is ignored.
  01,1: Distance in pixels to offset this pose upwards?
  Then a list of each joint change in this pose. These joints are in the same order as in the list of joints.
  Each joint change is 4 bytes long:
    00,2: Rotation. Every 0x4000 corresponds to 90 degrees.
    02,1: Distance in pixels to position this part relative to the part its connected to. (Signed.)
    03,1: ID of the frame to replace this joint's frame with. FF means don't replace it, keep it at what it was before.

List of hitboxes:
Each is 8 bytes long.
  00,2: Rotation. (Signed.)
  02,1: Distance in pixels. (Unsigned, unlike distance for joint changes.)
  03,1: Width in pixels.
  04,1: Height in pixels.
  05,1: Corresponding joint ID.
  06,1: Bitfield.
    Least significant bit first.
    Bit 1: Can deal damage.
    Bit 2: Can take damage.
    Bits 3-8: Unused?
  07,1: 00?

List of points:
Each is 4 bytes long.
  00,2: Rotation. (Signed.)
  02,1: Distance in pixels. (Unsigned, unlike distance for joint changes.)
  03,1: Corresponding joint ID.

List of joint IDs by draw order:
Each is 1 byte long. The number of these is the same as the number of visible joints.
  00,1: The ID of the joint to draw.

List of animations:
Each is 1 + (3*number of keyframes) bytes long.
  00,1: Number of keyframes.
  Each keyframe:
    00,1: The pose to use.
    01,1: The number of frames to ease into this keyframe.
    02,1: 0 1 2 3 TODO
