; Changes the game initialization code to load a new overlay (86) in addition to the ones in the original game.

; To fit our new code we need to make some space. We replace lines like ldr r4, =27h with mov r0, 27h so that a constant pool isn't necessary for them. Most of this code is just the original code shifted up a bit.
