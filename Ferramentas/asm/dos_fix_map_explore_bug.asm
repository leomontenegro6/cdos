; This patch fixes a bug in DoS where the map will consider the player to be in the next room over if they are on the very edge of the screen.
; This bug causes the glitch in the room randomizer (or sliding puzzle in the vanilla game) where walking through a door will reveal the map tile of the room you would have normally entered without room randomizer/sliding puzzle.
