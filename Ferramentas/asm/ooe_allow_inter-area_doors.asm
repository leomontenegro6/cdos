; In the vanilla game, doors are not designed to take you between two different areas, and trying to use them like that results in a number of bugs, namely crashes, improperly loaded tilesets, and the wrong map being on the top screen.
; This patch fixes these bugs so that doors work correctly even when the source room and destination room are in different areas.

; Incomplete - This patch still causes crashes and incorrectly loaded tilesets in many circumstances.

; Bug 1: The code that loads the sector overlay for the destination sector assumes that the current area index is also the destination area index.
; Fix: Simply load the area index from the stack, because an earlier call to GetAreaSectorRoomIndexesByRoomPointer already determined the correct area index, and we simply need to use it.

; Bug 2: The transition room's asynchronous tileset loading code assumes that the current area index is also the destination area index.
; Fix: Similar to the above, GetAreaSectorRoomIndexesByRoomPointer was just called, so we can use the area index on the stack again.
;   But in this case, there's a key difference: that function was called twice, first for the door on the left of the transition room, then for the door on the right.
;   The original code preserves the sector indexes of both calls, but only preserves the area index of the right call, so even if we use this area index it will only fix the bug when going right, not left.
;   So we must modify the code to preserve both area indexes as well as both sector indexes, and then load the proper one depending on whether the player is going left or right.
; First, make more room on the stack for an extra area index (0x10 -> 0x14 bytes)

.org 0x020393F0
  add r0, r13, 0Ch ; Push where it reads the sector index over to match where it actually is now (8 -> 0xC bytes)
; Now we make the left and right doors store to different spots on the stack.
.org 0x020393A4
  add r1, r7, r8, lsl 2h ; r8 is 0 for the left door, and 1 for the right door. So the left door's area index gets stored at offset 0, the right door's at offset 4.
.org 0x020393DC
  ; These 4 lines of code here run if the doors are swapped (door 00 is on the right, door 01 is on the left).
  ; What this code originally did is swap the two sector indexes in the stack so things still load right even if the level designer swapped the doors.
  ; What we need to do is update the offsets when swapping sector indexes (8 and 0xC -> 0xC and 0x10), and also add new code to swap the area indexes as well. So we go to free space to do all this (see below), and nop out the other 3 lines.

  ldr r0, [r13, r5, lsl 2h] ; r5 is 0 if the player is trying to enter the left door, 1 if trying to enter the right door.



; Bug 3: If the player moves through a transition room fast enough that the asynchronous tileset loading didn't get the chance to fully load the tilesets, the game logic pauses when they touch the door so it synchronously loads all the remaining tileset data instead. This synchronous code also assumes the area index of the destination room is the same as the current area index.
; Fix: The asynchronous transition room code stored what sector and area it was loading (sector index at 020ECA9C, area index at 020ECAA8). It already uses the sector index correctly, we just need to do the same for the area index.
;   Specifically, the synchronous code indicates to the LoadTilesetsForSector function that it should use the sector index at 020ECA9C by passing -1 as the sector index argument.
;   So first off, we change the synchronous code to also pass -1 as the area index to indicate that it should also use the previous area index.
.org 0x02038D1C
  mvn r0, 0h ; Originally this loaded the current area index, we replace it with -1.

; Bug 4: If the player has the top screen set to the map, it does not automatically update to the new area's map. The player can manually fix this by pressing select twice, but it should automatically reload.
