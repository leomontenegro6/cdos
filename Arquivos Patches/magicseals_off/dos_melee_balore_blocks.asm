  add r3, r3, 8h ; Add 8 pixels to the hitbox height so it will be rounded up to the nearest 16px instead of down.

; There's a bug where the whip code only checks the weapon's first hitbox, even though some weapons have two hitboxes at once.
; To do this we need a new variable, r6, to keep track of whether we're on the first hitbox or the second one.
; We also need to preserve the pointer to the weapon entity (argument r0 passed to this function).
; So change all the push/pop statements for this function to include r0 and r6 (instead of just r4,r5,r14).
